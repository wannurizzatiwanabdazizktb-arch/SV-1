    The aim of scientific visualization is not merely to present data attractively, but to **enhance comprehension and decision-making** through visual analytics. 
    Applications span across disciplines such as **climate science**, **medicine**, **engineering**, **data science**, and **environmental studies**.

    In this course or module, students will learn to:
    - Select relevant datasets for analysis and visualization.
    - Apply various visualization techniques such as graphs, maps, and 3D models.
    - Interpret visual outputs to support scientific conclusions and policy recommendations.
    
    By the end of this exercise, students should be able to produce **informative, accurate, and interactive visualizations** that effectively communicate scientific findings to both expert and non-expert audiences.
